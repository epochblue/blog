## PyTennessee 2018 Recap

For those who don't know, PyTennssee is the regional Python conference held in Nashville, TN every year.
PyTN 2018, the fifth year of PyTN, was my first year planning and organizing a conference, and while there were hiccups along the way, it was, by any objective measure, a success.
In this post, I intend to go over the numbers for PyTN 2018: talk selection numbers, speakers, tickets sold, attendance, sponsorship money raised, how money was spent, and what if anything was leftover at the end.
In a separate post, I'll go over some of the feedback we received after the conference and dig into what we're going to change for next year.
So, without further ado, let's look at PyTN 2018 by the numbers...

### Speakers and Talks


### Tickets and Attendees


### Sponsorships


### Expenses
